It got a bit hotter again.It wasnicer, like in the low 90s, but this weekend and the beginningof this week isback to 100+. Still better, but summer is not quiteover yet! It just keepsholding on. It's nice being in a car ofcourse, but I do think it would be funto be on a bike. What mycompanion and I are planning (even though we don'thave much of a sayhaha) is that whenever we separate, probably this transferor afternext transfer, that we will both stay in our Ward and we willjustdivide it again. And I'll have our old area, the smaller one, and gobackto part time biking. And we will both have some new companions. Ithink thatwould be really good! But our mission needs to get moreSpanish speaking eldersand sisters.

The coolest thing of this week started last week! Last Sunday,therewere two ladies at church that we had never seen before. We talkedtothem, and they weren't members! And they didn't really know anyone intheWard. So we were kinda confused about how they got there, but wewere totallyokay with it! So we got their information, and got overto their apartments toteach them. And it was a really good lesson! Weshowed because of him, which isan awesome video, and talked about ourlife here. It was pretty powerful allaround, and the one lady startedout just kinda there and ended prettyinterested! Her friend got herto join her, she has already talked tomissionaries a bit in Mesa, andjust moved here. So they both seem really cool!Hopefully we will beteaching them pretty regularly now.

The bummer of theweek is that Efrain has been having some issues, sohis baptism won't be assoon as we had hoped. He still wants to bebaptized, and he wants to work onthis, but it won't be super soon.Kind of a bummer. There are a good amount ofpeople wanting to bebaptized that have to change some pretty major thingsbefore they can,it's tough cause there's no easy answer. We just gottamotivate themto change a little!

Also the Rodriguez family seems to be onlyinterested in mutual. It'sa bummer, but still a good start. The kids are superenthusiastic sowe just need to make the parents catch it!

Other than that,not much else! Looking forward to another great week!

Oh and we went bowlingtoday! I did surprisingly well, bowled a 137then a 138! I'll attach a pictureof the zone too. It's shrunk a bit.

We had another lesson with that new family. Not all thekids were there this time, but we still had a really good lesson aboutthe plan with the mom and her daughter. They are super excited aboutlearning and reading, but are kind of lazy about getting to church.There are lots of people that if they can just get there the firsttime, it'll change things completely and they will want to come more.So many times that first time at church is the hardest, and theexperience there can affect a lot of their progression after that. Wehad a good amount of people at church though yesterday, which wasreally cool to see. Even the bishop made a comment about how it seemedfull and there seemed to be lots of non members. We have been tryingto work more closely with Ward leaders and such and that has helped usdevelop some stronger relationships with the members.

We had one awesome lesson about the plan of salvation with a ladynamed Rosario. We talked to her about the restoration a week ago andshe thought it was so cool. She's very attentive and really seemed toget the importance of the plan as well. She seemed really hit by theability to know for herself about where she's going and stuff. Prettycool.

Thursday was crazy, I ate something a little bad and that night had abit of fun. Couldn't sleep very well, and had a couple of episodeswith a bucket. We got some soda and Gatorade and I ate some toast, andI was okay. Wasn't too fun of a night though.

Can't think of anything else that really happened this weekspecifically. Good week though! I'm excited for another!

Love,Elder Clough"},{ "subject":"Another week bites the dust", "date":"February 1, 2015", "content":"We had a really good week this week. On Friday we had a zoneconference where President Griffin talk to us about making sure thepeople we baptize are more converted to the gospel. It was really cooland our zone did a little musical number. Our zone is the most splitbetween Spanish and English and so we sang armies of Helaman part inSpanish and part in English. It was cool. How are zone has a lot ofsisters. My old area was only elders.

Yesterday we had five people at church. That was pretty good. Thisfamily that has been in active for a long time came for the third weekin a row with their daughter Kiara who has not yet been baptized. Itwas really cool to see them there and they haven't been to our wardthis often in a long time. Also a couple named Beatrice and Julio cameto church and they are super solid. We had a cool lesson with themlast night where we talked about family history. I haven't talkedabout family history with very many investigators before that in mymission. It was cool because they started out sort of confused but bythe end Beatrice was really excited to do family history work herselfand learn about her ancestors. Julio will probably have more of arough time because he knows almost nothing about any of his family. Hestill seemed open to trying just skeptical of his chances of findinginformation.

We have been teaching this lady named Marta and her daughterDominique. They are super cool and super excited to learn about thegospel! The only problem is that they're also busy and have not beenable to come to church. It's kind of a bummer but Dominique is superexcited to come to church and we are sure that she will be able tomotivate her mother more. They totally accept everything we teach andare anxious to talk more.

This week we have a baptism with a kid named Fabian. He is nine yearsold and pretty crazy. He has a very short attention span but isexcited to be baptized. His mom is a member and his family has beenreturning to activity lately. Teaching kids is nice because they aregenerally not breaking the law of chastity. Which is a common problem.

This morning was kind of cool because we got to help teach an Englishclass. There is a lady that teaches English to whoever wants to comeon Mondays in the morning. It's interesting to see people who don'tknow it all struggle a little. English is a pretty tough language tolearn. Spanish can be hard at times because it has lots of rules, butthat also makes it easier. It's going pretty well. My companions bothspeak Spanish really good so that helps.

Everything is going good. The weather is really nice. Hope everyone isenjoying the cold, here it gets up into the 60s-70s every day. Can'tcomplain!

It was pretty exciting and the kids really seemsto enjoy church as well as mutual this past Thursday. Also a fewpeople that have been learning about the church for a while came whichwas cool and brought our total to nine investigators at church. It wasa lot more than I have had the rest of my mission usually. One of thepeople that came to church is named Kiara and she is the daughter in aless active family. She has been a huge help to her family and now isthinking about getting baptized. She is 10 and absolutely loves thechurch. Whenever we leave chapters or pamphlets to read, she is theone that gets the whole family motivated to finish their homework.

Last night during the Super Bowl, we went to see a part member family,and we could not escape seeing some of the game. We went in and heardit on, but the family luckily said they would turn it off. Then theycould not find the remote, so we ended up talking to them while theywere half watching the game. Sounds like it was not a very good game.I am surprised that The Broncos did so well. Everyone seems to haveexpected the Panthers to win. I'm just hoping for the Lions next year.

We also had a weird experience last Thursday. In the middle ofplanning in our apartment, we suddenly got a call from some sistermissionaries telling us that there was someone else in the church withthem and that a window got broken. So of course we ran to the church,and it turns out that they had seen 2 12ish year olds running out ofthe church. Coincidentally, there were 2 12-year-olds outside thechurch on the grass. We talk to them but they denied everything. Aftertalking to them and trying to get their story out, we had the sistermissionaries come over and asked them if they were the boys they hadseen. The sister said yes, but the boys denied everything. We got aphone number from the boy, and told them we would go check thechurches cameras. The boys started walking away, and we called thephone number. It turned out it was a number from the Phoenix newsstation or something like that. So we hopped in the car, and took offafter them. Elder Sperry pulled up next to them in the truck andjumped out. The boy, Richard, was frightened, especially when told himthe number was fake. Richard started telling us everything, and itturns out he had been throwing rocks and accidentally broke thewindow. The kids told us that then they were thirsty and came into thechurch to get a drink of water. We told him that was not very smart.We did our best to make Richard feel really bad, and got him to comeback to the church to apologize to the sisters. Everything got workedout and it made for an interesting afternoon.

Back on a spiritual note, we had some really good lessons with Lola.Before this week we have never taught her children. But we brought theyoung men's president and he did a really good job of getting her 14year-old son excited about coming. We had some really cool lessonswhere we invited Lola to share her testimony on some of the principlesbecause she has already learned just about everything. Now the kidsare excited and making friends in the youth group.

Finally, we had our baptism yesterday with Fabian. He is a very hyperkid, and we barely got him calmed down enough to come into the roomfor the program. But it all worked out and he was excited to bebaptized. I will attach a picture.

Overall, it was a very good week, and things are going very well. I'mexcited for this week, and we will get to have interviews with ourmission president. It should be fun

Love,Elder Clough"},{ "subject":"Mesa Trip", "date":"February 15, 2015", "content":"We had a great week!  The best part was the trip on Wednesday to the Mesa Temple.  We went with Lola and her kids Rodrigo and Valentina, and her baby named Hazel.  We found a couple RMs, Ivan and Eduardo, to drive us.  They are both really cool, but it was kind of weird traveling to the Mesa temple as a caravan of a new Camaro and a lifted Jeep Wrangler.  Especially with Lola and Hazel riding in the camaro.  We got there safely, and in style.  Of course, I rode in the Jeep.  We went through this great walkthrough talking about eternal families.  We also watched a video about a family that gets baptized and thinks of their younger sister/little daughter that died a few years before and how they can be with together forever.  Also just shows a lot of blessings of the gospel.  Pretty good video, but the translation was a few seconds late so it was a little funny haha.  The kids really liked everything, and when we invited them to prepare themselves to be baptized March 6th, Lola still seemed unsure, but then asked Rodrigo and he said "Yeah!" right away.  It was great because Lola seemed very caught off guard by his excitement and just said "well okay, I guess we will think about it and work towards that then."  It's interesting how kids always seem so much more open and into it and help their parents move forward... probably because it's true!  And they're just less set in their ways.  So many people love the doctrine and that sort of thing, but just don't want to change.  They just straight up say something like "well I've been ______ for so long, just by tradition, I don't think I could change.  It's just how my parents raised me."  But Lola and her family seem to be on there way!  They all love coming to church, and have gotten really involved in all the  weekday activities.

Yesterday we had ward conference.  One of the counselors in the stake presidency is from Mexico and doesn't actually speak lots of english, so he did really great talking to the people in our ward and motivating them.  He used to be a bishop here as well so the whole ward loves him and respects him.  He is a very good leader.  He did a great job at calling the ward to repentance a little while still being loving.  It was awesome.

We finished this service project that we've worked on a couple times before.  We scooped off the first couple inches of dirt off this older couple's lawn and then put 10 tons of rocks back on to cover it.  The guy is getting a little old to maintain a lawn so rocks are easy!  It was pretty fun, and cool to see the project from start to finish.  We worked with JustServe and the City of Phoenix, and they really liked us there!  The older couple is super nice, and couldn't thank us enough for our help.  They brought us sub sandwiches and chocolate milk and seemed to just want us to take a break so they could tell us random stories from their life.  It was really fun!

All around it was a very good week.  I'm going to attach a picture of the temple trip that is also on facebook now, as well as a couple pictures from the service project.  Hope to have another great week!
